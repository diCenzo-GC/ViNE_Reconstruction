# ViNE: A Virtual Nodule Environment

ViNE is a metabolic model of a nodulated legume, consisting of the interacting partners *Medicago truncatula* and *Sinorhizobium meliloti*. The final model contains root and shoot tissues, as well as nodule tissue subdivided into five distinct developmental zones. The nodule tissue contains representations of the metabolism of both the plant and the bacterial partners, as well as cross-talk between the organisms.

Within this directory you can find all of the scripts used to build ViNE, as well as the scripts used to build an updated metabolic model of free-living *S. meliloti*. In addition, all scripts for the analysis of ViNE in our associated manuscript are provided.

### Input Files

If you wish to run our scripts to build ViNE, a few additional files need to be downloaded and placed in the correct directory.
* The previously published version of the *M. truncatula* metabolic reconstruction needs to be [downloaded](https://github.com/sysbiolux/MedicagoScripts/blob/master/Matlab/Data/MedicagoTruncatula.xml) and placed in the directory 2_ViNE_Reconstruction/4_Integrate_Models/1_Produce_Plant/Data as well as 2_ViNE_Reconstruction/4_Integrate_Models/2_Produce_Nodule
* The *chem_xref.tsv* and *reac_xref.tsv* files must be downloaded from [MetaNetX](https://www.metanetx.org/mnxdoc/mnxref.html), placed in the directory 2_ViNE_Reconstruction/4_Integrate_Models/5_Finalize_Nodule, and the files renamed *chem_xref.txt* and *reac_xref.txt*, respectively.

If you wish to run our scripts to analyze ViNE, a couple additional files need to be downloaded and placed in the correct directory.
* The *chem_xref.tsv* and *reac_xref.tsv* files must be downloaded from [MetaNetX](https://www.metanetx.org/mnxdoc/mnxref.html), placed in the directory 3_ViNE_Analyses/4_Carbon_Source/Add_Sucrose_Metabolism/Finalize_Nodule, and the files renamed *chem_xref.txt* and *reac_xref.txt*, respectively.
