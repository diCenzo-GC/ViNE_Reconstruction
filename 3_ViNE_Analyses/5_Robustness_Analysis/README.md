# Robustness analysis

This directory contains the scripts prepared by Michaelangelo Tesi to run the robustness analysis on ViNE. The scripts are as follows:

### MyRobAnalysis_on_one_reaction.m
This script performs the Robustness Analysis on one reaction

### RA_Classify_BacteroidIId.m
This script classifies each of the reactions included in the BacteroidIId compartment into one of the three classes Steady, Synergic, Competing

### RA_Classify_BacteroidIII.m
This script classifies each of the reactions included in the BacteroidIII compartment into one of the three classes Steady, Synergic, Competing

### RA_Classify_BacteroidIIp.m
This script classifies each of the reactions included in the BacteroidIIp compartment into one of the three classes Steady, Synergic, Competing

### RA_Classify_BacteroidIZ.m
This script classifies each of the reactions included in the BacteroidIZ compartment into one of the three classes Steady, Synergic, Competing
